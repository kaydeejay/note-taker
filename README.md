# Express Note Taker Application

An application that uses a node/express backend to record user's notes.
The user can utilize the front-end of the application to read, write, and delete notes.
The backend accomplishes those tasks by saving them to a json file that mimics a database.

The front-end of this site was designed and coded by Trilogy Education Services, who runs the 
PennLPS Coding Bootcamp at UPenn in which I am currently enrolled.
